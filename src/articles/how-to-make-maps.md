<div class="article">

I've made a few maps for fantasy world building, and I've come up with a process that makes it relatively easy. This process is more for fantasy maps - if you're trying to make something realistic, there are guides out there for how to do stuff based on techtonic plates and erosion and such.

You can either do this all physically, or all digitally, or a combination of both (like I do). If you're going physical, you'll be using pencils and erasers - **DON'T use a pen!** You need to erase things at several points throughout the process.

The first thing you'll need is a hex grid. I use ones from [incompetech](https://www.incompetech.com/graphpaper/hexagonal/) - the size of the hex changes how large of a space your map can be - **large hexes** means your map is going to be **small**, and visa versa. If I'm doing a map to show multiple continents, I use a hex size of around 0.5cm, and for individual islands I do a size of around 1cm.

For this article, I'm using a large size hex of 1.2cm:

The numbers and letters along the side aren't a neccesary part of this, by the way - however, they can make some later stuff easier, so feel free to use them if you like!

## 1. Outlining

Now, here's a fun part: we're going to draw the outlines of our landmasses. The key here is that we're not looking for the *specific* coastlines, we're just trying to get the general shape. This is what the hexgrid is for - giving us a guide.

I think for my map, I'm going to draw an archipelago, with one big island in the east.

![The initial line has been drawn](../../images/articles/map_line1.jpg)

Here's the first line I drew - notice how it basically follows the hexes, but is a bit wibbly? that's how we get our initial shape. The exact wibbles don't really matter - we'll be changing them up later. At this point, I realised I didn't quite like the shape of the bump in the middle, so I changed it to something more hook-like. I also decided to extend the coast westwards a little more after that:

![The vague coastline of our big island](../../images/articles/map_coast1.jpg)

I know it's hard to see, but I've filled out the rest of the island. Remember that in this stage we're still following the hexes - the reason we use hexes instead of squares or just a free space is this: it's easy to create borders that look natural-ish - like that bay in the center east of the island. I'm going to draw a few more islands now:

![Several more islands](../../images/articles/map_islands.jpg)

For most of the islands, I stuck to keeping with the hexes, but for a few of the smaller ones I had an idea and just freeformed it. Even then, the hexes are useful for scale. Several of the islands I drew were ugly and weird looking, so I erased them - don't be afraid to erase something and draw something better! It doesn't matter if your islands aren't super detailed - we're just looking for blobby shapes here.

Some things to make it feel more natural: if you make it so that the islands either look like they fit together at some point in the long ago past, it feels more natural. Also consider: the sides of islands that are open to the sea are often subject to significantly more erosion than those protected by other islands.

This step took me around 20-40 minutes.

## 2. Detailing Coastlines

Once you're happy with the vague shape of your landmasses, it's time to move onto the second step: detailing! Of course, if you don't need any more detail than this, you can stop here. But I like to do this step. Be warned, though: it can take a **long** time. And this is the step where we really do need the eraser.

The process is this: erase one-hex, then re-draw it with a lot of details. I'm going to demonstrate this with the southwest most island.

![And the final island, after detailing](../../images/articles/map_detail_demo5.jpg)

If you sit down and try to do the entire detailing for the island all at once, it would be incredibly overwhelming - but because we already have the guideline for the general shape, plus also we're only doing small segments at a time, it's actually really easy (and really fun). An advantage of this method that I like is that if you mess up a detail, it's ok! Just erase the hex again.

Here's the fully detailed map:

This took around 30-45 minutes for me - it may take longer or shorter for you. Note that I did make a few changes - I made the South Eastern Portion of the big island more penninsula like, for example. And then I digitised it:

![The digital version of the map](../../images/articles/map_details_digital.jpg)

You don't have to go to the effort of doing this at this stage - you don't ever have to digitise it, if you don't want to. I usually do out of habit. An aside: the hexes are now slightly misaligned to where they originally were, because of the way I digitised it, but that shouldn't really matter.

But.... why have we kept the hexgrid? Well...


## 3. Mountains and Biomes

It's time to add stuff to the map! We're going to put mountains and biomes in - using the hexes, of course! I like to come up with a list of biomes ahead of time. I'm going to say my archipelago is in a relatively arid part of the world, so my biomes are going to be:

  * crags
  * dunes
  * savannah
  * wetlands
  * bushlands (like the australian bushlands)
  
I'm also going to make the island Southwest island a dormant volcano.

The first step is to draw the major mountains onto the map:

![Mountains!](../../images/articles/map_mountains.jpg)

And now to fill in those biomes I was talking about. I decided to colour in the mountain areas with a light shade of grey:

![The biomes are here](../../images/articles/map_biomes.jpg)

If you're not working digitally, you can use coloured pencils for this, or just write the names of the biomes where they will go. **Important Note: These don't really look good as a final map - these are more for your reference as a writer/worldbuilder/Game Master.** So you will probably want to make a copy of your map first.

Having these biomes on hexes is really useful for a tabletop game: you can create tables of unique events to happen for each kind of biome, and it encourages you to keep things interesting.

If you're looking at your map, you may realise you have too many biomes, or too few. That's ok! Come up with more (or less), and change a few hexes. I'm thinking I need another one, just for the southwest island, so I'm adding a "mushroom marsh" biome.

Weird fantasy biomes are fun to play with, if you're making something that doesn't need to be "realistic" - one of my other maps had a volcanic swamp, cliffs made of a coral reef (complete with above-water kelp and flying fish), and a hill-land that had been poisoned by a curse, among other more normal environments.
