      synopsis: Two schoolteachers, Barbara and Ian, follow one of their students
        (Susan) home, only to discover a strange policebox in a junkyard...
      review: The last 3 episodes of this story are dry and difficult to watch. They
        have several repeated scenes, and the plot is not very interesting
