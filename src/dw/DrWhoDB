[Doctor 1 [Season "1" [Story "An Unearthly Child" 1 4 None Partial (Just "only episode 1") "Two schoolteachers, Barbara and Ian, follow one of their students (Susan) home, only to discover a strange policebox in a junkyard..." "The last 3 episodes of this story are dry and difficult to watch. They have several repeated scenes, and the plot is not very interesting",Story "The Daleks" 2 7 None No (Just "this story is incredibly slow paced, so I can't recommend it, unless you really want to watch the origin of the daleks.") "The Tardis crew land on the alien jungle planet Skaro, and are captured by a mutated race of people known as The Daleks" "The main cast is fleshed out a lot in this story, and there is a lot of tension. But the pace is excruciatingly slow.",Story "The Edge of Destruction" 3 2 None Maybe Nothing "Something is wrong with the Tardis, and it seems like one of the crew has sabotaged the ship..." "Very tense and mysterious episodes - however the second episode drags on a bit, and plot contrivances force everyone to act out of character",Story "Marco Polo" 4 7 All Maybe (Just "if you're ok with a reconstruction") "The travellers arive in China and meet Marco Polo. He coerces them into joining his caravan, and they end up embroiled in political intrigue in the far east..." "One of the first historical stories, and it works really well as a contrast to the stories around it. The villains are more complex and the problems they face are more personal. Not much action - which means the lack of video isn't a problem.",Story "The Keys of Marinus" 5 6 None Highly Nothing "The Tardis crew must travel all across the planet of Marinus to find the keys to the AI that runs their society..." "This is a big story, divided into several little ones - a format that works very very well, and mitigates a lot of the pacing issues the early seasons had. However the script was rushed, and you can tell.",Story "The Aztecs" 6 4 None Yes Nothing "Barbara is mistaken as an Aztec God, and attempts to use this mistake to end the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, despite the Doctor's warnings about changing history..." "The Aztecs is a \"historical\" story, but it's such an innacurate view of the situation that it can hardly be called that at all. However, it is a very interesting plot.",Story "The Sensorites" 7 6 None Maybe (Just "it is very interesting, but also very slow.") "The sensorites is an interesting idea..... but it's very slow. I remember enjoying it as a child, but now? I can't really recommend it to everyone" "The Tardis lands on a ship, trapped in orbit around a planet of Psychic aliens known as the Sensorites",Story "The Reign of Terror" 8 6 (Some [4,5]) Yes (Just "but note there are missing episodes, which makes it harder to get through") "The Doctor decides to take Barbara and Ian home... but accidentally lands them all in the middle of the Reign of Terror, and they instead have to try not to lose their heads..." "Surprisingly accurate and interesting. The 2 episodes which are missing footage are a slog to get through - without the motion, the pacing is more obviously slow"],Season "2" [Story "The Planet of Giants" 9 3 None Yes Nothing "The travellers find themselves on a planet much like Earth, but many times larger" "Entertaining and fun, and a good start to the second season - although some of the actors give rather stilted performances"]]]
