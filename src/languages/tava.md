title: Tavan

Tavan is a free-word-order language focused on circumfixes and infixes.

To account for this, every word is structured in a relatively simple way:

> * the root of a word is VOWEL CONSONANT VOWEL  (for example, _ava_ (communication))
> * the root can then be surrounded by CONSONANTS to indicate function (_t-ava-n_ (the communication))
> * or the root can be infixed with a VOWEL CONSONANT to indicate lexical information (_av-at-a_ (loud communication))
