This is the date of the site overhaul - after months of stagnation, I decided to finally getting around to reviving this site.

* Instead of being generated with Hakyll, which I found too limiting, the site is generated with Shake instead
* The blog is gone entirely - replaced by this log
* The colourscheme is even more garish than before
* The Doctor Who Guide is now here!
* Everything else is.... empty, because I haven't figured out exactly what I'm going to do with it yet

Unlike a blog, which has individual articles in a row, all of the log is on one big page. Maybe in the future I'll have it split into multiple pages, but for now it should just load all at once.
