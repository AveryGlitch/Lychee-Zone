title: Big Update

This is the date of the site overhaul - after months of stagnation, I decided to finally getting around to reviving this site.

* Instead of being generated with Hakyll, which I found too limiting, the site is generated with Shake instead
* The blog is gone entirely - replaced by this log
* The colourscheme is even more garish than before
* The Doctor Who Guide is now here!
* Everything else is.... empty, because I haven't figured out exactly what I'm going to do with it yet

### Why a log?

Unlike a blog, which has individual articles in a row, all of the log is on one big page. Maybe in the future I'll have it split into multiple pages, but for now it should just load all at once.

If I want to write an article, it should be given it's own page here, and made a prominent piece of work, rather than something to be blogged and then forgotten.

A log is easy to update with small things - I don't expect people to be clinging to every single word, I expect people to come here to see if anything significant has changed since their last visit.
